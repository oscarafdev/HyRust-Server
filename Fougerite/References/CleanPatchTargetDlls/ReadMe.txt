These are the "cleaned", deobfuscated versions of the dlls. (Except MeshBatch)
There are also untouched dlls that you can use for patching though the uLink.dll cannot be patched by Fougerite then.
Also, the original ulink.dll contains failures, and bugs so It is not recommended to use.

There is also an extra dll (uLink-DYN.dll) which i have modified manually to fix a bug reported. (Issue 95 on github page.)

You have to decide which clean dlls are you going to use to use the fougerite patcher on.
